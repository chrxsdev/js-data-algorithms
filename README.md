## Purpose 🎯

The goal of these exercises is to:
- 💪 Strengthen your understanding of fundamental data structures and algorithms.
- 🧠 Develop problem-solving skills by applying different patterns and techniques.
- 🏆 Prepare for technical interviews and coding challenges.

## How to Use 🛠️

1. Navigate to the folder of the pattern you want to practice.
2. Open the JavaScript file and read the problem description.
3. Implement the solution or analyze the provided solution.
4. Run the file to test the implementation using Node.js:
   ```bash
   node <filename>
   ```

## Patterns Covered 🌀

- **Divide and Conquer**: Efficiently break down problems into smaller subproblems.
- **Frequency Pattern**: Use frequency counters to solve problems involving comparisons.
- **Multiple Pointers**: Use pointers to reduce time complexity in linear structures.
- **Sliding Window**: Optimize solutions for problems involving subsets of data.

## Requirements ✅

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): Ensure you have Node.js installed to run the JavaScript files in this repository.

## Credits 🙌

The exercises in this repository are inspired by the course [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/?couponCode=MT250908G1) by Colt Steele. Special thanks to the instructor for providing such a comprehensive resource for learning algorithms and data structures.
